          <h3>What timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
          <p>I have tried meditating in the morning and that is working well on getting me focused for the day. I also try meditating at night to wind down for the day and to help me get a restful sleep. I also use the Pomodoro Technique which has always worked well for me.
          </p>
          <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
          <p>I found the videos about creating habits really interesting as most of the time people do talk about the attitude to create a habit more than creating a habit and having the attitude come along with it. I think that is a great way to create habits. Also that some people need to be counterintuitive ways to be productive - I'm someone that works really well with creating lists and goals.
          </p>
          <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
          <p>The Pomodoro Technique. Meditiating in the morning and creating small habits.
          </p>
          <h3>Which will you experiement further with?</h3>
          <p> I am going to experiment more with meditating at night - I find it difficult to not pick up my phone when it's really late or to stop thinking. I also will experiement more with creating small habits.
