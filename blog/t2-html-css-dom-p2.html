    <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
      <p>Grid based design is a way of making it easy to organise and structure your webpage. It is made up of rows and columns. Usually there are 12 columns and a row with a width of 100% of the page.

    <h3>What is the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
      <p>Responsive webpages are great for allowing the webpage to be viewed in response to the size of the screen or browser it is being viewed on. This means the webpage is usually formatted better to accomodate tablet and mobile phone layouts.
      </p>
    <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
     <p>A semantic structure helps the web brower define what the content is, a big heading, a slightly smaller heading, paragraph or image. Then CSS goes on to how that structure should be displayed.
