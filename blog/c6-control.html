          <h3>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h3>
          <p>I would say that if I continuously get stuck on a problem that I can't seem to solve within what I find a timely manner, I get very upset. I feel that I should be able to solve the issue and by not being able to I doubt my abilities making me more frustrated and upset and then wanting to discontinue for the day. I also can get quite upset when I find that the reason something hasn't worked is from minor typing errors as it's such a small mistake that creates a big annoyance. I want to be getting better at typing and not continuously going back to fix small errors.

          <h3>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h3>
          <p>I like this technique to find an appropriate response to a situation without letting emotions go crazy. Acknowledge the emotions but don't let them change the outcome that you would like. I also find just taking a moment to breathe is very good to have to ground yourself again.
