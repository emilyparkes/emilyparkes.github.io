          <h3>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h3>
          <p>I learnt that I'm a better listener than I thought. I know that a lot of the time I can miss a few details but repeating it back really helps to clarify everything they have said. It was also really good just to take a moment to really pay attention to the conversation. I did this task with my partner and I know that my partner finds it hard to talk for that long, I'm more of the talker between us. So in that sense I thought it was a great chance to listen to my partner without any interuptions and let any pauses happen until everything was said. My partner also appreciated having the time to get all the information out and time to think about how to say everything before I would normally jump in. I think this has improved how we converse and has made me more patient when listening to what my partner is trying to communicate.</p>
          <h3>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h3>
          <p>I think all of them are really helpful but perhaps I'll use mostly taking one mindful breth a day. That way I have something very manageable even on the busiest day and hopefully that will lead to a few more each day. I think I may even have a buddy system with my partner and sneak easy mindfulness into my partner's life too!</p>
          <h3> Any other musings?</h3>
          <p>I think having mindful conversations will be incredibly useful. I do tend to get a bit distracted while listening to some of my friends because they way they talk about a subject can seem messy or not in order, their thoughts can sometimes come out before it forms a proper order - I know I do this too. So mindful conversations will help to understand the jumbled spoken thoughts and let everyone process emotions on opposing thoughts and take the time to understand properly the others thoughts and reasonings behind it.</p>
