          <h4>A time I got blocked on a simple problem</h4>
          <p>I had a lot of trouble with Syntax Errors and it would take me a while to find out what I'd missed or done wrong. I'd usually solve them by going back over notes, changing my code to see how that changed the outcome and sometimes googling forums to find out what I'd missed, or how the code is supposed to work. I found this very frustrating because I would get them constantly and it would upset me that it didn't feel like any information was sticking. Though when I was able to solve a problem or at least realise how close I was to doing it correctly that would make me feel a lot better that I wasn't far off, and make me feel like it must be sinking in! I learnt from doing all of this that I need to stay calm and take breaks when I get too frustrated that I can come back with a fresh attitude. Also to take getting very close to a correct answer as a win because that at least means I undersatand what I'm meant to be doing and that I just need to focus a little more on smaller details the next time so that each exercise was a step better. I especially learnt not to be so hard on myself as looking at slack I could see that others are struggling too, and fair enough because most of us are learning JavaScript for the first time and there is a lot to learn.
          </p>
          <h4>Problem Solving Techniques</h4>
          <h5>Pseudocode</h5>
          <p>This is a text based method for drafting code that you want to create. Writing out each step using plain English first helps you to recognise the steps you will need to write in code for the desired outcome. This is a technique I use mostly in my head to try figure out what I need to add to my code but this is something I also might find easier to use if I write it out.
          </p>
          <h5>Try Something</h5>
          <p> As simple as it sounds, try something until it works. This is usually my go to until I find I havent found the right solution and then I go on to googling...
          </p>
          <h5>Rubber Ducky Method</h5>
          <p> I had to look this up to understand it more clearly but as far as I know this just means you talk out loud about the code you are writing and go through the process to hear youself and perhaps hear what you've missed. I use this sometimes but usually talk to a friend or family member and then sometimes I can hear what I've missed.
          </p>
          <h5>Reading Error Messages</h5>
          <p>Sometimes I can easily read an error message and know where I have to fix something and other times I don't get it at all and use other methods instead.
          </p>
          <h5>Console Logging</h5>
          <p>Console Logging throughout your code shows what's coming through correctly and can help you see where you've slipped up. I don't often use this method but perhaps it will help me if I use it more frequently.
          </p>
          <h5>Googling</h5>
          <p>Easy to find a million answers to your question and is a method I use a lot. I have tried to not use this method as much as sometimes an answer is given without why or how it works, and so sometimes that makes it too easy to solve a problem and feels like a cop on on the learning. When googling answers I try to find answers that have an explination that helps to explain the solution in a way I might find easier to understand.
          </p>
          <h5>Asking your peers for help</h5>
          <p>I think this is a great way to get advice and a new outlook on problems and solutions. Its a comfortable way for me to ask for help and even if the other peer doesn't know the how to help it's nice to figure it out together.
          </p>
          <h5>Asking coaches for help</h5>
          <p>This is a method I'm slightly less comfortable with because I'd prefer to use this as a last resort. I'm always fearful of looking silly for missing simple mistakes or for getting something wrong that perhaps should already be engrained into my head. Ultimately I know that is the job of the coaches and that I'm learning and it's okay to ask 'silly' questions as it's part of learning.
          </p>
          <h5>Improving your process with reflection</h5>
          <p>I always try to reflect on my work and see where I went wrong, I've made tonnes of notes to go back to if I ever don't understand but I do wish I kept a little log of thing I messed up and to show the difference between my version and the correct one.
          </p>
          <h4>Describing Other Elements</h4>
          <h5>.map()</h5>
          <p>The .map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element in order.
          </p>
          <h5>.filter()</h5>
          <p>The .filter() method creates an array filled with all array elements that pass a test (provided as a function).
          </p>
          <h5>.reduce()</h5>
          <p>The .reduce() method reduces the array to a single value.
