    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
    <h2>21 August 2017</h2>

    <h3>What learnngs did you take from the chapter?</h3>
      <p>Well I would say I already know and do a few of the points mentioned in the first chapter - such as feeling emotion in the body first and then deciding how to respond. I have learnt from my own experiences that it is a lot better to recognise the emotion and be a mediator in the situation between your self and others. How should I react in a way that benefits everyone? Do I need to remove myself from the situation? I was however interested to find that doing things such as this can have such a huge impact on your personal and professional life. I also didn’t realise that there were so many scientific facts to back this up. I also believe that Emotional Intelligence is really important in life to get the best outcome for all people involved. People are so unique and go through many obstacles others may not realise, having friends and employees that are not only positive, but understanding of others and their own emotions creates a much better environment. It’s great to have the skills for a job, but they are no good if you can’t understand, manage or work with other people in your career. I can completely understand how having a high emotional intelligence creates great relationships between people and also makes sure that you get the best out every situation.

    <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
      <p>People easily get caught up in the day to day, stresses of the future and deadlines. Mindfulness helps you to slow that down, teaches your brain to focus on the now and be more appreciative. This is helpful both personally and professionally. My favourite way of meditating is to sit or lie down and concentrate on my breathing. Be conscious of each breath, each time I inhale and exhale. Then once I’m calm and in a meditative state I like to focus on the sounds, the smells and what I can feel. The birds and air outside, maybe a slight breeze inside. This helps to bring down whatever worries I may have and focus on the moment and appreciate it. This in turn helps in professional aspects of life because it teaches the brain to focus on the task at hand and what needs to be done to accomplish it. You focus on one task at a time - conscious of the decisions being made and doing so at peace, instead of getting stressed about every task that needs doing, when it’s due and working in a stressful manner not entirely paying attention to each choice. It enamours me to see what a difference a little bit of mindfulness can do to change how you handle your day.
