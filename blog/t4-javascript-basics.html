          <h3>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h3>
          <p>JavaScript works with HTML (the blueprint) and CSS (decor) to make a website dynamic (The family in the house). JavaScript can be used for accessing information and updating sites in real-time, for example adding live twitter or instagram post updates to a website.
          </p>
          <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h3>
          <p>Control flow is the order that the functions or instructions are carried out, for JavaScript this is carried out as it is written (start to finish). Loops are part of the code that is repeated until a certain action is completed. For example paying bills, the steps are repeated (like a loop) for each bill until all payments are complete.
          </p>
          <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
          <p>Data in arrays are organised like a list, to access data from an array you use the list position like a 'key' and the stored data is the 'value'. Objects are containers that store data and functions. To access the data in an object you use key-value pairings using a variable name that you assign to it.
          </p>
          <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
          <p>Functions accept data, preform an action with that data and return a result. They are used because they allow us to write a block of code and then reuse it without having to write out the code again.
