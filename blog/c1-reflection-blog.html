    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <h2>9 August 2017</h2>
    
    <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
      <p>I definitely think the mindset of the student is very important on deciding what their experience will be like. I also think that the way the programme is set up is great. It helps you go along at your pace and gives you a group of people to support you. I also do believe a lot of people learn by doing it themselves and making the mistakes themselves. Those experiences help you learn what you did that didn't work and how to avoid it. I think so long as you are willing to learn and know how to ask for help and give help when it is needed this is a fantastic experience and more institue should teach this way.
      </p>
    <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
      <p> I had good impressions from what I had heard about EDA from others and now experiencing it myself I think it is fantastic. It is scary starting something new, but the support from tutors and a cohort group is a fantastic way to start.
      </p>
    <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
    <p>I hope I engage well, I'm always happy to make new friends and help others and everyone is always learning so it is great to be surrounded with others that are the same in that way.
    </p>
    <h3>have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
      <p>Yes, I wasn't expecting anything in particular, but so far it has exceeded my expectations. I love how assignments and instructions have been organised and it makes the work easier to work through at a remote location.
      </p>
    <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning envirmonment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
    <p>Yes I am excited! I have studied in a similar way before but at the same time it is totally different. I am a little nervous to be so in charge of my learning but I also welcome all the challenges it brings too.
