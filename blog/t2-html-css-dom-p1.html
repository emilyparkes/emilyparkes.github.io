          <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
          <p>The best and most simple way to describe it would be like a house, HTML is the blueprint of the house. The CSS is decoration of these rooms. The DOM is the book all the blueprints and mood boards (for the decor) are in. The DOM catogorises them by the room, the electrical plan, plumbing plan, the jib, then paint, then furniture, then furniture decor. You can edit things in the book (DOM) but this doesn't actually alter the house until the Project Manager (developer) replaces a document (edits the HTML or CSS).
          </p>
          <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
          <p>Boxifying design is a way of creating a grid structure on your webpage so you can see how design elements fit together on the page for the overall look. Like the blueprints for a house, it is made of grids but those grids arent seen on the actual house, it is so you can create the shape of the house and know how much relative space it takes up.
          </p>
          <h3>What is the box model?</h3>
          <p>Each element on a webpage is in a box. It is made up of:
            <ul>
              <li>Content - Content of the box, either text or image.</li>
              <li>Padding - A transparent area around the content.</li>
              <li>Border - Border around the padding and content.</li>
              <li>Margin - A transparent area around the border.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
