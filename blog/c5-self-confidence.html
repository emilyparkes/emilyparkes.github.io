          <h3>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h3>
          <p>Both require you to kind of step out of your own body and observe what is happening around you and within. Having mindfulness wll also help with self-awareness and vice versa.
          </p>
          <h3>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h3>
          <p>So I tried the 'Body Scan'. I found this to be a unique way of being mindful and also having self-awareness at the same time. I also found it interesting that my body felt different when thinking of a really happy time. You can feel the emotion in your body. 
          </p>
          <h3>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h3>
          <p>I think that it is an excellent way to think of emotions as it will help you manage them better. It's very good to be able to have control over your emotions and evaluate how you feel and then rect in a way that gets the best outcome.
