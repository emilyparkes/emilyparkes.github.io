          <h4>Meditation Process</h4>

          <h6>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h6>
          <p>I found this quite hard to do because I do consider myself a bit of a perfectionist, I can get quite annoyed when things don't go the way I want them to and it becomes stressful. I wanted to prove to myself that I could go through the process and also achieve the product I wanted. This is a bad habit of mine that I am trying to break. I understand that it's more important to learn then to just produce perfect work. It's important to make mistakes. Once I stopped stressing about making the site perfectly the way I wanted, I actually found it easier to understand and learn what I was doing or needed to do to try achieve what I wanted.</p>
          <h6>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2 of Search Inside Yourself?</h6>
          <p>I thought meditation was a great way to calm and sort of empty the mind - in a way that means you focus on one thing and relax. I have meditated ocassionally over the years in different ways, such as streching before dance classes, organising gear before a rowing race and even doing yoga. Each of my hobbies and classes had their own way of meditating and mindfullness.</p>
          <h6>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h6>
          <p>What I learnt from chapter 2 was that not only does it make you calmer and can change your outlook on a day but also that it can change your health. It can change your immune system so you get sick less often and that it also changes your brain. I didn't realise that it was an exercise for the mind. </p>
          <h6>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h6>
          <p>Not really, I've meditated in multiple ways before so I'm familiar with thoise meditation techniques. But it is just great to see that it helps so many aspects of your self and your life. I am happy that it's slowly becoming easier to encorperate it into daily life.</p>
          <h6>Any other musings?</h6>
          <p>Since starting to meditate frequently, I have become a more calmer and at peace kind of person and this has helped with job interviews. I've managed to get a part time job that I feel is something I will enjoy and has bonuses I feel I deserve due to my prievious experience. I'm also a lot more in control of emotions, mainly in deciding what to do with them and how to react to them.</p>
