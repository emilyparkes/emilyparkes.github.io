          <h3>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.</h3>
          <p>A responsive site is one that adapts the layout and/or content to fit different browser sizes. It is important because a responsive site is one that is more easily viewed across devices, creating a better user experience. None of the content will be unavailable or cut off. </p>
          <h3>What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</h3>
          <p>A mobile first design is when a site was created with the mobile phone size layout in mind first, using what's called a Media Query. Media Queries change the layout of a site using the 'min-width' label to tell the browser that anything larger than this 'min-width' uses the following layout descriptions.This means that mobile and other smaller devices can load quicker and don't need to proccess all the css before selecting what applies to the screen size. </p>
          <h3>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</h3>
          <p>Frameworks are basic html or css layouts that can save you from typing out lots of code yourself. This can be very helpful but also can be a problem if you are wanting to be more creative. It mainly depends on what frameworks you use and how. </p>
          <h3>What a wireframe is and why we use it.</h3>
          <p>A wireframe is a blueprint for a webpage, it shows us the layout that we want to achieve and how this will translate into html and css divisions. This makes it easier to see how we should be coding our html and css to create our desired look.</p>

          <h3>What aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to impliment and why.</h3>
          <p>Well it is expected to be difficult considering this was my first time doing it, but I think the hardest thing for me is that I'm a bit of a perfectionist. It was difficult to design something relatively basic that I would still find visually pleasing. I haven't yet finished everything I wanted to have on my website design, but I am really happy with how it has turned out so far.I think a couple of things are a tad too advanced for me yet ot at least are a little mor time consuming than what is needed to show what i'm capable of at this tage and what I understand. It was also hard because I over complicated it for myself but once I realised how simple it can actually be it was a lot easier to get into motion.</p>
