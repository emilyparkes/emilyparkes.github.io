          <h3>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h3>
          <p>It looks very ideal.
          </p>
          <h3>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, what are your core values and what do you stand for?</h3>
          <p>My core values are respect, compassion, open-mindedness and kindness. I believe these are the strongest for me as they fit in best with what I stand for. I want to live in a world where we are all equals, that are respectful and understanding of the beliefs and lives of others. I stand for supporting each other and the environment.
          <h3>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h3>
          <p>I found this quite interesting as I believe it is good to go through the emotions that may make you feel as though that was failure and instead use it to change it to a postive, a mistake you know how to avoid and a step towards something better. Though i do feel reflecting on failures that aren't recent is a bit counter productive.</p>
